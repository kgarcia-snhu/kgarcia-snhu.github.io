# Welcome to kgarica-snhu's GitHub ePortfolio Page!

### The projects associated with this page are part of the Computer Science program from Southern New Hampshire University. The ePortfolio contains narrated code review, enhancements to completed work in three categories of (Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases), justification narratives, and a professional self-assessment.

###👋 Hi, I’m @kgarcia-snhu
#### My name is Keone Garcia, best pronounced as (Ke Own E). 


###🌱 I’m currently learning ...
#### I’m a first-generation dual major, studying a bachelors of computer science and data analytics. Both of which have concentrations in software engineering and project management. I’ve been in the computer science program since January of 2018 and am completing my 4th year. While in the computer science program, I have learned that there are many applications for hardware and software to co-exist. When building a computer to meet the needs of a client cost, performance, and limitations are considered to provide the best possible recommendations. When developing code, security policies are used to ensure that code written relinquishes bugs, vulnerabilities, and data loss. I have also learned that having the ability to work with diverse programming languages along with comments in code are good practice, and provide avenues to reverse engineer software.


###👀 I’m interested in ...
#### I aim to work as a software engineer and a data analyst/scientist. Being new to coding, SNHU has provided me with my first steps to developing code. I plan to pursue an internship or a position in the industry that continues to teach me industry standards so that I may implement each skill as I learn. Ultimately I would love to achieve the status of a data scientist, I hear many that pursue this position start as data analysts and learn code to develop algorithms that satisfy analytical reasoning for reports. I believe that both a software engineer and data analyst carry duties necessary to computer science as one creates data and the other collects and analyzes data. At some point in my career, I would love to teach students based on my experience in the industry.
