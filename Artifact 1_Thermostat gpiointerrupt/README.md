# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech
## Emerging systems, architectures, and technologies

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?
The thermostat supports the peripherals of I2C by reading the TMP006 temperature sensor, the peripherals of GPIO by activating a LED to indicate the output to the thermostat where LED on = heat on and LED off = heat off, and the UART peripherals by simulating data being sent to the server which can be viewed from the terminal Com3 echo characters written for <30,26,0,0339> <temperature(30), setpoint(26), heat(0), seconds>. When looking into the uses for hardware architecture of Texas Instruments, Microchip, and Freescale. I found that Texas Instruments Real-Time Microcontrollers are of lower cost and provide a diverse amount of implementation due to the 32bit configuration and amount of pins (38 pins). The Freescale architecture is intended to be used more for wireless applications like broadband routers, lowering power consumption yet increasing performance while using a single chip. The Microchip architecture contains a larger flash and ram capacity, uses a lower bit count, and includes (RTCC) for clock and calendar functions. The microchip performs well with integrated touch functionality for LCD displays. (Design News, 2017) To create a smart thermostat using the TI board, my recommendation is to use a Freescale architecture. The TI board CC3220S is a single-chip wireless MCU with 0MB of flash memory, 256kb of RAM, Arm Cortex M4 processor at 80Mhz. This prototype is developed to showcase how the CC3220S board can act as a thermostat accessing a temperature sensor (TMP006) to read the room temp (via I2C) degrees Celsius. Simulating data transfer to the server via terminal from the Com port (via UART) and indicate if the heating system is on or off by displaying a led light (via GPIO) when the temperature is different than the setpoint. The SysTecâ€™s thermostat architecture must have enough Flash and RAM to support the code and performance. Therefore, I believe that a Freescale architecture for a thermostat would resemble a Google Nest device. This architecture is geared towards wireless connectivity allowing access to the thermostat from mobile applications, containing limited functionality on the device as settings are controlled wirelessly. Regarding the other styles of architecture, a microchip architecture for a thermostat would resemble an older style of a temperature control unit that uses analog input like a dial and has no LCD display. A TI architecture would resemble a Honeywell digital thermostat that provides the user with input by digital buttons and contains an LCD display showcasing settings, option menus, and alerts.

/* ========== Summary ========== */

Application that toggles an LED(s) using a GPIO pin interrupt.

Peripherals & Pin Assignments
When this project is built, the SysConfig tool will generate the TI-Driver configurations into the ti_drivers_config.c and ti_drivers_config.h files. Information on pins and resources used is present in both generated files. Additionally, the System Configuration file (*.syscfg) present in the project may be opened with SysConfig's graphical user interface to determine pins and resources used.

CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0 - Indicates that the board was initialized within mainThread() also toggled by CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_0
CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1 - Toggled by CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_1
CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_0 - Toggles CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0
CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_1 - Toggles CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1
BoosterPacks, Board Resources & Jumper Settings
For board specific jumper settings, resources and BoosterPack modifications, refer to the Board.html file.

If you're using an IDE such as Code Composer Studio (CCS) or IAR, please refer to Board.html in your project directory for resources used and board-specific jumper settings.

The Board.html can also be found in your SDK installation:

<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/boards/<BOARD>
    
/* ========== Example Usage ========== */

Run the example. CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0 turns ON to indicate driver initialization is complete.

CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0 is toggled by pushing CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_0.

CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1 is toggled by pushing CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_1.
![Setpoint Buttons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79305154/152252009-628dd65b-d38a-4864-904e-12e032a25ac6.png)

Application Design Details
The gpioButtonFxn0/1 functions are configured in the driver configuration file. These functions are called in the context of the GPIO interrupt.

Not all boards have more than one button, so CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1 may not be toggled.

There is no button de-bounce logic in the example.

TI-RTOS:

When building in Code Composer Studio, the configuration project will be imported along with the example. These projects can be found under <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/kernel/tirtos/builds/<BOARD>/(release|debug)/(ccs|gcc). The configuration project is referenced by the example, so it will be built first. The "release" configuration has many debug features disabled. These features include assert checking, logging and runtime stack checks. For a detailed difference between the "release" and "debug" configurations, please refer to the TI-RTOS Kernel User's Guide.
FreeRTOS:

Please view the FreeRTOSConfig.h header file for example configuration information.
